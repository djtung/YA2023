      <h1>The Mansion</h1>

        <span class="type" style="--n:1746">You and Emma board the flight to Atlanta, chatting about what you might find. You can't help but feel a sense of anticipation as the plane begins to take off.

        After landing and clearing customs, you hail a taxi and give the address of the location on the map. As you drive through the city, you marvel at the bustling metropolis that is Atlanta. The streets were lined with tall, gleaming skyscrapers and the sidewalk teemed with people. You catch a glimpse of the famous Atlanta skyline, towering above the city and dominating the horizon.

        As you continued on, the city gradually gave way to more residential areas, and eventually the taxi pulled up to a large, imposing mansion. The mansion was set back from the street behind a high fence, and a long driveway led up to the front door. It was grand and opulent, with large windows and a sweeping front porch.

        You make your way to the front door, taking in the view of the beautiful garden as you take the walkway. Emma knocks on the door and after a while, you hear someone approach the door. A well dressed butler opens and looks at you inquisitively.

        You don't know what to ask, but just want to enter to try to find the next clue. Emma speaks before you can. "Hi, my name is Emma. We just wanted to ask, who owns this mansion? It is beautiful".

        "This mansion belongs to the late Walter Williams. I keep the grounds now as per his instruction, though no one currently resides here."

        "Walt? I'm Emma Williams", she says in disbelief. "Walter was my grandfather!"

        The butler pauses for a moment but then gives you a curious look. He doesn't seem surprised by this. "Come inside", he says.</span>

            <span class="txt">The butler takes your coats and leads you to a sitting room where he offers you drinks. You sit on a plush sofa, surround by antique furniture and tasteful decorations.

            The butler returns with a bowl of nuts. "Master Williams gave me instructions for those who claimed to be his kin. I'm guessing you want to search the mansion. If you do, you'll have to tell me what is in this bowl. It should be easy enough for a Williams."
            
            "Tell me how many cashews, almonds, pistachios, and walnuts there are. In that order."
        
            Hint: 4 numbers.</span>
