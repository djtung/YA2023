        <span class="type" style="--n:702">You line up in the order the AI asked, being careful to follow the rules as explained. As you finish, you see the same lights that scanned Emma earlier flash back and forth across you.
        
        After a moment, you hear an encouraging chime from the robot, as the lights on it turn green and the door opens for you. You open the door and walk further into the passageway.
    
        You reach a large ornate room similarly designed to the rest of the mansion. Around the room are ancient artifacts and treasures collected from all around the world, sitting atop stone pedestals and covered by protective glass. It's an impressive display, rivaling that of well known international museums.</span>

            <span class="txt">At the center of the room lies a large chest, and you and Emma know this is the treasure that you've been looking for, at least the one that was mentioned about in the letter.

            "Looks like we need to solve this puzzle to open the chest", says Emma.

            Hint: The answer is 3 words. The first line of the cipher is solved for you.
