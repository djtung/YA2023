      <h1>The End</h1>
      <div class="center">
        <span class="type" style="--n:2497">You returned to the airport one final time after finally completing the treasure hunt. It was bittersweet. Emma had finally experienced the adventure she was looking for, and fulfilled her grandfather's wishes of finding all the lost treasure. But she felt a deep sense of melancholy as she realized this was it, and it would eventually be time to return to her menial day to day life.

            Approaching the clerk at the airport, you give her the information compiled from the letters found in the treasure chests scattered around the world. She looks puzzled as she tries to find your flight, as it doesn't come up in the system.
            
            "Can you try it again?", asks Emma, confident that there would still be more to this adventure. "I'm sorry, there isn't any flight like that in our system", replies the clerk.
            
            As you're about to give up, you see a well dressed man running towards the check-in desk, phone in hand. He looks at you, and after a moment tells you, "Come with me." You follow him through the airport.
            
            You make your way through the airport, and eventually to the upper floor where he takes you into his office. "We've been waiting a long time for this," he says, reaching into a cabinet. "We have instructions from a Mr. Williams for whoever would ask for this flight. Please take this letter, he intended it for you." He gives you a letter in a small, sealed envelope and leads you back to the airport terminal.

            Emma carefully opens the envelope and pulls out the letter.
                
            "Dear Emma,

            Congratulations on completing the treasure hunt. I am so proud of you for following in my footsteps and solving the riddles that led you to the treasure. I hope that this journey has taught you something about yourself and the world around you.

            I want to remind you that this is not the end of your journey, but the beginning. You have found a great wealth, but it is not the only wealth that exists in this world. You have a wealth of potential within you, and I urge you to not waste it.
            
            Do not let your newfound riches hold you back from reaching your full potential. I may no longer be with you in the physical world, but I will always be with you in spirit. I believe in you, and I know that you can achieve anything you set your mind to.

            With love,
            
            Grandfather."

            <span class="txt">Tears begin to well up in her eyes as she reads. There was a sense of sadness, but also of inspiration and hope. She puts the letter away and looks at you with a smile.

                "I want to thank you for everything. You've given me so much by helping me with this treasure hunt. I couldn't have done this without you."
    
                "It was my pleasure", you tell her, and she reaches out your hand for you to take. You give it a firm shake. "I'm glad I could be a part of this journey with you."
    
                You look at her for a moment longer, then Emma turns and walks away, heading towards the airport and the next chapter of her life. You watch her go, feeling a mix of sadness and happiness. You felt proud of the woman Emma had become, and knew that she was destined for great things. You turn and walk away in the opposite direction, ready for your next adventure.
    
                The end of the treasure hunt marked the beginning of a new life for Emma. With the wealth and experiences gained, Emma felt more confident in herself and her abilities. She quit her menial job and ventured on to new and exciting opportunities. With her grandfather's words in mind, Emma was determined to live her life to the fullest and make the most of the opportunities that come her way.
