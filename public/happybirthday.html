        <span class="type" style="--n:1007">"Never give up, persevere always. Words to live by", Emma says out loud, as she turns to you with a wistful smile.
        
        You think of what to say to her, but before you can reply you hear a low rumbling from the bookshelf, as it parts to reveal a hidden passage through the wall. You turn on your flashlight to get a better look. The ground in the passageway is dusty, undisturbed and surprisingly well kept.
    
        You come to a large room with a door, but it doesn't look like there is a handle, lock, or puzzle to be able to open it. Suddenly, a light turns on from what looks like a drone above the door. The futuristic look of it combined with the age of the passageway is jarring.
    
        Two beams of light from both sides of the drone begin to dance up and down Emma's body, as if scanning her.
    
        "Williams, Emma Faith. Born Feburary 19th, 1995," you hear coming from the drone.
    
        "It's an AI", Emma says with a gasp. "How do you know who I am?"</span>

            "He also trained me to let the right people into this room. So if you want to continue, you'll have to play my game."
