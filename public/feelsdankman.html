        <span class="type" style="--n:474">It takes you and Emma together to open the heavy lid of the chest. Inside was a glittering array of treasure, the chest filled to the brim with gold and precious gems. Also inside were intricate carvings of animals and ancient relics from a forgotten time. They looked valuable.
        
        Emma let out a gasp of amazement as she laid her eyes on the treasure. The fact that you had barely survived your encounter in the rainforest makes the experience even sweeter.</span>

            <span class="txt">At the bottom of the chest you spot a sealed envelope. Inside, a letter with the words <span class="txt2">Departure: Vancouver</span> was highlighted on it.

            It seems important so you keep the letter with your personal belongings.
        
            You and Emma share a hug and begin to make your way back to the city, eager for the next leg of your journey.
