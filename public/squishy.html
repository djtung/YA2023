        <span class="type" style="--n:1119">You return back to the chef after organizing the recipes in the office. "Excellent", he says. "You've worked hard, take your break now but come back in 15 minutes".
        
        As you turn to exit through the back door of the kitchen, you see a dimly lit staircase near the back. Random boxes line both sides of the staircase, it looks like the kitchen staff used this as extra storage space. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere until you run your fingers along the back wall, exposing the secret passage.
    
        The passage exposed a dark room with a new clue inside. It was a map, showing a dense rainforest deep in the heart of Brazil. The map was marked with an X, indicating the next location to go to. You quickly make arrangements to travel to the rainforest, eager to continue.
    
        You land at a small airstrip near the designated location on the map and set out on foot, the rain falling hard around you. The rainforest was dense, and the going was slow. You have to push your way through thick underbrush, and wade through muddy streams. As you press on, the storm becomes more intense.</span>

            "We should wait here until the storm passes", Emma tells you. You don't like the idea but there isn't any other option. As you try to stay dry, you notice the space on the rock start to shrink as the water begins to rise.
