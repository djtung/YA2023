        <span class="type" style="--n:911">"Impressive, you can come in", he says to you as he holds the door open. You give Emma a smile as you make your way inside Borealis, to the dismay of the other patrons waiting in the long line.
        
        As you enter, you are greeted with the sound of lively music and the smell of exotic cocktails. The bar was crowded, with people dancing and having a good time. You make your way through the crowd, searching for the next clue.
        
        You try to find the secret passage mentioned in the notes you found previously, and see a door at the end of a hallway near the back which looks like it could be it. As you enter the door, you see a host of busy workers preparing dishes. It's the kitchen.

            Hint: Enter the names of the famous recipes in order, there are 6 words in total, 2 for each recipe.
