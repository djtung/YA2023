        <span class="type" style="--n:604">The chest was sealed with a large, intricately designed lock that seemed almost impossible to open. With bated breath, you and Emma enter the password into the lock together.
        
        After a few minutes of tense silence, there was a click, and the lock sprang open. Emma's hands shook as she reached out to lift the cover of the chest. "We did it," Emma said, her voice filled with wonder. "We actually found the treasure."
      
        Inside was a glittering array of gold and jewels. There were gold coins, precious gems, and ancient artifacts that seemed to be from all over the world.</span>

            You feel this may be important later on. But for now, you can't help but smile as you enjoy the riches you've found so far. Closing the chest, you and Emma make your way out of the tunnel, ready for the next leg of your treasure hunt.
