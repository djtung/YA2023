        <span class="type" style="--n:672">Pushing the buttons on the throne indicated by the puzzle causes the entire chamber to shake as you see a large stone overhang near the top of the chamber begin to appear. At the same time, windows on the ceiling of the chamber also begin to creak open.
            
        "Is that supposed to happen?", asks Emma. You look up at the windows, but instead of the chamber filling with light it begins to fill with sand. "No, I don't think so", you tell her, the sand flooding in like a waterfall.
        
        You and Emma rush to find materials and try to escape the rising sand. There isn't much time to decide what to do, as the sand reaches your knees already.</span>
