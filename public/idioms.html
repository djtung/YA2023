        <span class="type" style="--n:896">Eventually the space on the rock becomes so small that you and Emma are standing back to back, eyes closed to shield from the heavy rain. You wait for what seems like an eternity as the sound of rushing water echoes around you. Finally, the rain begins to slow and the waters around you recede. You're safe, albeit soaked.
        
        "Come on, lets keep going", Emma says, no doubt restless from the time you've waited. You follow her off the rock and deeper into the rainforest.
    
        You approach the marked location on the map and find a clearing. At first glance, it doesn't appear as if anything significant is there. However, you're sure this is the right place.
    
        "Take a look at the ground here", Emma says, as she kneels down and runs her finger through the soil. "I think there's something buried here." You decide to dig in hopes of finding the next clue.</span>

            <span class="txt">After a while of digging, you finally hear a "clink" as you push your shovel deep into the earth. Working quickly, you excavate the chest from its hiding spot. 
                
            As you brush off the dirt, you notice the following markings on the chest:

            "11 12 24 43 14 24 34 45 23 15 23 11 34 14 24 44 53 35 43 45 23"

            "I think I know what this is", Emma tells you. She takes out a paper and writes the following note on it. "We can use this to find the hidden message. The numbers are row - column pairs that will turn into letters".
