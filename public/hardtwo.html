        <span class="type" style="--n:747">You quickly get to work, fashioning the pieces of wood together to form a crude ladder. Emma ties the rope around the rungs to secure it and then threw the rope up to the windows. It was a difficult climb, and your arms ached from the effort, but you finally reach the top. Emma follows close behind you, and you both climb out onto the roof. You take a moment, lying on the floor, exhausted. She breathes a sigh of relief as you look out at the beautiful view of the ancient city.
        
        The air begins to cool around you as you see the setting sun beyond the horizon. You're finally safe, and in front of you on the rooftop there is a large treasure chest. It was surprisingly well kept despite the age and weathering over the years.</span>
