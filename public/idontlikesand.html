        <span class="type" style="--n:522">You open the chest with bated breath. You had overcome so many obstacles to reach this moment.
        
        As you opened the chest, you start to see the glittering jewels and gold that lay inside. The chest was filled with precious gems of all colors and sizes, gold coins, and intricate gold and silver trinkets. Emma reached out and picked up a large diamond, holding it up to the light that was just starting to fade over the horizon. It sparkled and glittered, sending beams of light dancing around the rooftop.</span>

            You take the note with you, feeling like you may need it later on.

            As you climb down the rooftop and back through the ruins, you can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and saisfaction. Carefully, you make your way back through the large chamber and towards the entrance, the sand still thick in your boots from the day's adventure.
