          Emma couldn't help but feel a sense of awe as she took in the beauty of the snowy landscape. The snow was deep and untouched, and the only sign of civilization were the faint tire tracks on the road.

          You stop at a remote cabin that seems abandoned, but after searching you find a hidden door that leads underground. Inside, a vault has been carved out of the solid rock.</span>
