        <span class="type" style="--n:566">You and Emma arrive at the airport. It's bustling with activity, as travelers from all over the world rushed to and from their flights.
          
          You walk through the terminal, luggage in tow, the sound of announcements and the chatter of people filling the air. Emma couldn't help but feel a sense of nervousness and excitement as you make your way through.
        
          The airport is large and modern, with sleek marble floors and high ceilings. You get the feeling that you may not be able to find your gate and that you'll miss your flight.</span>
