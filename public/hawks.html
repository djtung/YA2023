        <span class="type" style="--n:1219">The chest is made of ornately carved wood, adorned with gold filigree. You and Emma can hardly contain your excitement as they you the heavy lid. Inside, the chest is filled with glittering jewels of every color, sparkling in the light. The jewels are set in intricate gold and silver settings, forming necklaces, bracelets, and rings.
        
        Among the treasure is another letter, which looks to have Emma's grandfather's writing on it.
    
        "My dear Emma," the letter began. "If you are reading this, then you have succeeded where many have failed. You have found the Williams family treasure and unlocked the secrets that have been hidden for centuries. You have proven yourself to be a true adventurer and I am proud of you. What you've found here is what I have recovered over the years from around the world, and collected here in this vault. I hope you are able to find the rest and succeed where I failed."
        
        The treasure you have found is not just a collection of riches, but also a symbol of the legacy of our family. I have left it for you as a gift, but also as a challenge. I hope you will use it wisely, and pass it on to the next generation. With love, Grandfather."</span>

            Near the bottom of the letter, you see the word <span class="txt2">Poland</span> circled. As it stands out from the rest of the words in the letter, you decide to remember it for later.

            As you take what you can and prepare to leave, you see Emma talking to the butler. They have a long conversation about the future, but you can't make it out. You call an Uber and let Emma know it is time to go.
