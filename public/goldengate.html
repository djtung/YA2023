        Walking ahead, you hear the sound of water deep below you as you come to a large cavern. There is a big gap in front of you, a sure death if you fall into the underground river below. You can see the opening on the other side where the path continues, but it is too far to jump.
      
        It's too deep into the cave to try and bring in help, but you see various piles of rubble and building materials at the mouth of the cave where you entered.</span>
